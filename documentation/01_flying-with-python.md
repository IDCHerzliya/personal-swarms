# 01 Flying your drones with python code

The instructions in this walkthrough have been based from this [guide](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-stem-drone-bundle/). However, I'll include here instructions specific to the VR lab PC of the Magic Lab. 

## Preliminaries
- This assumes that you have done and completed all the steps found in the [Startup Guide](https://github.com/IDCHerzliya/personal-swarms/blob/a9512044456fa36c8851c89610160cce5e68b601/documentation/startup-guide.md). 
- Also you need to make sure that python is installed. To check this, simply open command prompt and type ``pip3 install cflib`` which is the core python framework that we will need this. Terminal should tell you that this requirement has already been satisfied. Else, it will proceed with installation. 

## Running the first flight scripts
There are many ways to do this however I would suggest we go the route of composing your code in a text editor such as Sublime and then compiling it in a command prompt. So you will see the instructions to be based on these platforms. 

- For this step, you will need to use this code: [01 Fly Script 01](https://github.com/IDCHerzliya/personal-swarms/blob/11edbfdf693d833f317113539336c4ab3fd30ff3/documentation/01_flyscript_01.py).
- Dont forget to attach the crazyRadio PA dongle before you proceed any further. 
- In your command prompt, run the code. You can do this by typing ``python 01_flyscript_01.py``. Wait for it and see that the drone should fly.

# 03 Flying with the Loco Positioning system 

The instructions in this walkthrough have been based from this [guide](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-flying-using-lps/). However, I'll include here instructions specific to the VR lab PC of the Magic Lab. 

There are also other Positioning Systems available in the Bitcraze collection. For now we will be using this platform. If you wish to check out the different positioning systems, you may view them [here](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/system/positioning/). 

## Preliminaries
- This assumes that you have done and completed all the steps found in the [02 Flying Drones Autonomouosly](https://github.com/IDCHerzliya/personal-swarms/blob/7cb3f8e5bb44497bada3e1f54f2581c7395040b5/documentation/02_fly-two-drones-autonomously.md). However, this is an **optional** step for you to be familiar with the difference compared to this guide. You can still do this guide even without completing the previous guide. 

## Hardware and components Needed
- You will need the [Loco Positioning Deck](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/loco-positioning-deck/) and the [Loco Positioning Node](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/loco-positioning-node/) to be able to proceed with this guide.

## Setting up the appropriate binaries and software
- Download and install the Loco positioning configuring tool from this [link](https://github.com/bitcraze/lps-tools/releases). It is a .exe file and proceed and complete the installation.
